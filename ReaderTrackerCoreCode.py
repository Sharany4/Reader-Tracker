# able to add and remove from a tobe read list ,and move to a read list.
# Later this will be expanded so the can create custom lists.


# TODO Create a Book class
# This class will have a title, author, year
# It will also store what collections it is apart of
# It will also havea to string method to represent itself


# TODO Create a BookCollection class
# hTHis class will represent a collection of books.
# It will provide functionality to add and remove books, and sort them
# how the user customizes.
# Will need to figure out how to book books from one collection to another ones read
