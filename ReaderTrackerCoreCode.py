"""
I am slowly integrating the storage into the code. I am leaving the previous code to save testing.
Once storage in all integrated, will retest core code to make sure it works correctly

Baseline Testing:

Ensure all existing tests for the core functionality pass before making changes.

Implement Storage Methods:
Add the storage-enabled versions (add_book_with_storage, etc.).
Write tests specifically for these methods, focusing on integration with storage.

Re-test Core Functionality:
Re-run your old tests to confirm that nothing has been unintentionally broken by the new additions.

Refactor:
Once youâ€™re confident that the storage-enabled methods work perfectly, remove the older methods that no longer add value.

Cleanup:
Update any remaining tests or code that relied on the old methods.
Ensure that your final codebase is streamlined, with no redundant functionality.
