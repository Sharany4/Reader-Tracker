In this project, I created a Reader Tracker to keep track of my to-be-read lists, and read lists, and to update me when I hit milestones. 

I am building this project in PyCharm which is giving me the opportunity to learn Python. I will also be learning about creating a user interface and how to handle events e.g. button clicks.
