In this project, I created a Reader Tracker to keep track of my to-be-read lists, and read lists, and to update me when I hit milestones. 

I am building this project in PyCharm which is giving me the opportunity to learn Python. I will also be learning about creating a user interface and how to handle events e.g. button clicks.  


Status: the user can create and delete users, create books to put in certain collections. They can also remove books from certain collections which was recently implemented. The next step is to boundary checks and perfect before making the app easier to use.
