To-Do List for Reader Tracker Project

# TODO: SHould I change the structure so that  the books store there own data and the collections are just a list of books?

1. Design and Build the GUI
    - Finish remove book button to allow removal from all collections, or just some collections
    - Let the books in a collection be displayed in a table
    - when right clicking a book, show a context menu with options to makr as read, delete, more to other collections
    - when right clicked, scan the collectosn to see what collectiosn it be moves nad added to
    - add a search bar to search for books by title, author, etc.

2. Testing and Refinement
    - Test the saving/loading functionality: Ensure that the books are being correctly saved and loaded from both JSON and database formats.
    - Test GUI functionality: Make sure the GUI correctly updates the list of books and interacts properly with the backend logic.
    - Refine the codebase: Optimize and refactor the code for maintainability and scalability.
    - Let the user pick the base folder location
    - make it into a desktop app
