To-Do List for Reader Tracker Project

to do immediately
- check that the todos and try to fix if possible
- check whether the book structure needs to
- check if we need to have the collections list of books listi nthe python object, does it ever get used? as tey are ddded to storage
- allow the user to remove books fr om the seelcted collection,tell them which it will remove from aswell

1. Design and Build the GUI
    - Let the books in a collection be displayed in a table
    - when right clicking a book, show a context menu with options to mark as read, delete, more to other collections
    - when right clicked, scan the collection to see what collection it be moves nad added to
    - add a search bar to search for books by title, author, etc.
    - clean up code to remove the unused methods in book and collection, such as 'add collection' or 'add book' ( only the 'with storage' versions of these functions should be in use)

2. Testing and Refinement
    - Test the saving/loading functionality: Ensure that the books are being correctly saved and loaded from both JSON and database formats.
    - Test GUI functionality: Make sure the GUI correctly updates the list of books and interacts properly with the backend logic.
    - Refine the codebase: Optimize and refactor the code for maintainability and scalability.
    - Let the user pick the base folder location
    - make it into a desktop app
