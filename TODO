To-Do List for Reader Tracker Project

1. Design and Implement the Library Class
    - Create the `Library` class: This class will handle book and collection management, including adding new books and retrieving the list of books.
    - Pass the Storage Type: Make sure that the `Library` class accepts the storage type as a parameter, so it can interact with different storage backends seamlessly.

2. Design and Build the GUI
    - Create GUI layout: Develop a simple interface to display books, collections, and allow interaction (e.g., adding/removing books).
    - Integrate with core functionality: Ensure that the GUI interacts with the core code (e.g., `Library` and `Storage` classes) to save/load data dynamically.
    - Let the books in a collection be displayed in a table
    - when right clicking a book, show a context menu with options to makr as read, delete, more to other collections
    - add a search bar to search for books by title, author, etc.

3. Testing and Refinement
    - Test the saving/loading functionality: Ensure that the books are being correctly saved and loaded from both JSON and database formats.
    - Test GUI functionality: Make sure the GUI correctly updates the list of books and interacts properly with the backend logic.
    - Refine the codebase: Optimize and refactor the code for maintainability and scalability.
    - Let the user pick the base folder location
    - make it into a desktop app
